“Do prints from two different fingers belong to the same person? AI can tell” is a news article that tells us the AI discovered there might be an association between one’s different fingerprints. I thought there was no association between two fingerprints even on the same person.

## Summary:/摘要：

//Windows Copilot Summery
Researchers have developed an AI system that can match fingerprints from different fingers of the same person, revealing a surprising similarity between them. The system, which uses a neural network trained on millions of fingerprints, can identify the two prints from the same person 77% of the time, compared with 50% expected from random chance. The researchers claim that their system could help link different crime scenes by comparing latent prints from different fingers of the same person. They also say that their finding challenges the long-held belief in forensics that fingerprints from different fingers are unique and unmatchable.

## Personal Response:/個人回應：

/*
I was shocked that there were association between two fingerprint, this might break my fixed idea and it may be revolutionary for biology and a challenge for data security, Touch ID might not be safe.

I was shocked that there was an association between two fingerprints. This might break my fixed idea and it could be revolutionary for biology and a challenge for information security. Touch ID might not be safe.

## Critical Analysis:/批判性分析：

/*
This tech might help police find out criminal by fingerprint although it's not in their DB, this might also help improve the pettern recognization, it may be evidence some days.
*/
This tech might help police find out a criminal by fingerprints although it’s not in their database. This might also help improve the pattern recognition. It may be evidence someday.

## Connections to Real World:/與現實世界的聯繫：

/*
Many countrys doesn't force everyone put therir fingerprint/palmprint in a DB, many pending criminal cases only get a little part of fingerprintes, maybe we can use AI to Speculate the full fingerprint, then we can find the crime easyly.
*/
Many countries don’t force everyone to put their fingerprint/palmprint in a database. Some pending criminal cases only get a part of fingerprints. Maybe we can use AI to speculate the full fingerprint, then we can find the crime easily.

## Questions and Further Exploration:/ 問題和進一步探索：

/*
Although this tech help a lot, it might become a threat for data security, if it can speculate the fingerprint, can it "make" a fingerprint too? If it can, if might able to pass through the CAPTCHA too! so that Touch ID and Passkeys will not be safe ever!
*/
This tech is very helpful, but it may also endanger data security. If it can guess the fingerprint, can it also create one? If so, it may bypass the CAPTCHA as well! Then, Touch ID and Passkeys will never be secure!

## Conclusion:/結論：

/*
This new tech can help police to find out criminal, but it might also become a threat for data security.
*/
This new technology can help the police to find out criminals, but it might also pose a threat to data security.
