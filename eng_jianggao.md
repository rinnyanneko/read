# How AI Can Match Fingerprints from Different Fingers of the Same Person

You may think that fingerprints from different fingers are unique and unmatchable, but a new AI system challenges this long-held belief. Researchers have developed a neural network that can identify the two prints from the same person 77% of the time, compared with 50% expected from random chance. This system could have significant implications for forensics, biology, and information security.

## The Surprising Similarity Between Fingerprints

The researchers trained their AI system on millions of fingerprints from various sources, such as law enforcement databases and public datasets. They then tested the system on pairs of prints from different fingers of the same person, as well as pairs of prints from different people. The results were astonishing: the system could correctly match the prints from the same person in 77% of the cases, while only matching the prints from different people in 6% of the cases.

The researchers found that the system was able to detect subtle patterns and features that are shared by the prints from the same person, such as the shape, orientation, and spacing of the ridges. These features are not visible to the human eye, but they are captured by the high-resolution images used by the system. The researchers also discovered that the similarity between fingerprints increases with age, suggesting that the prints are influenced by genetic and environmental factors.

## The Potential Applications and Risks of the System

The system could have various applications in forensics, biology, and information security. For example, it could help link different crime scenes by comparing latent prints from different fingers of the same person, even if the prints are not in the database. It could also help improve the pattern recognition and analysis of fingerprints, which could lead to new insights into human biology and genetics. It could even be used as evidence in court cases, as it provides a higher level of certainty than the traditional methods.

However, the system also poses some risks and challenges for data security and privacy. If the system can guess the fingerprint from one finger, it might also be able to generate or synthesize the fingerprint from another finger. This could allow hackers to bypass biometric authentication systems, such as Touch ID and Passkeys, which rely on fingerprints as passwords. It could also compromise the anonymity and confidentiality of the users, as their fingerprints could be traced back to them.

Therefore, the system needs to be used with caution and regulation, as it could have both positive and negative impacts on society. The researchers hope that their system will inspire further research and innovation in the field of fingerprint recognition and analysis, as well as raise awareness and discussion about the ethical and legal implications of the technology.
