# My Reaction to "Do prints from two different fingers belong to the same person? AI can tell"

This news article introduces an AI system that can match fingerprints from different fingers of the same person, showing a surprising similarity between them. The system challenges the long-held belief in fingerprints from different fingers are unique and unmatchable.

I was amazed by this article, as it contradicted my previous assumption that there was no association between two fingerprints even on the same person. I think this study could have a huge impact on biology and information security, as it reveals a new aspect of human identity and biometrics.
I think this technology could be very useful for the police, as it could help them find criminals by fingerprints even if they are not in the database. It could also help improve the pattern recognition and analysis of fingerprints, which could lead to new insights into human biology and genetics. It could even be used as evidence in court cases, as it provides a higher level of certainty than the traditional methods.

However, I also think this technology could pose a threat to data security and privacy, as it could allow hackers to guess or generate fingerprints from one finger to another. This could enable them to bypass biometric authentication systems, such as Touch ID and Passkeys, which rely on fingerprints as passwords. It could also compromise the anonymity and confidentiality of the users, as their fingerprints could be traced back to them.

Therefore, I think this technology needs to be used with caution and regulation, as it could have both positive and negative impacts on society. I hope that the researchers will continue to explore and improve this system, as well as address the ethical and legal implications of the technology.
